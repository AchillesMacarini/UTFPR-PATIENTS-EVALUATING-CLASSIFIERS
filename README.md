# UTFPR-PATIENTS-DATA-SCIENCE
This project aims to analyze a dataset of medical patients, sourced from Kaggle (link to dataset). Our objective is to apply data science techniques to gain insights into the medical field, with a focus on patterns in patient demographics, conditions, and medical history.

## Dataset Information
The dataset, titled "[Patients Data (for Medical Field)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tarekmuhammed/patients-data-for-medical-field)" from Kaggle, contains records of patients, including variables such as age, gender, and medical conditions. It is used for educational purposes to demonstrate data preprocessing, analysis, and AI-based modeling.

## Project Goals
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing values, incorrect data entries, and formatting issues.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain insights through data visualization and descriptive statistics.
3. Interpretation and Reporting: Summarize findings and suggest potential implications for the medical field.
